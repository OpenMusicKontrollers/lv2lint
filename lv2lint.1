.TH LV2LINT "1" "Nov 18, 2017"

.SH NAME
lv2lint \- an LV2 lintian

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lv2lint
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] {\fIPLUGIN_URI\fR}*

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlv2lint\fP checks whether given LV2 plugins are up to the specification.
.PP
It not only checks the *.ttl, but actually loads plugins (and their UIs) and
checks whether required features and exposed extensions actually match between
binary and *.ttl.
.PP
It thus finds errors that cannot readily be found by just checking the *.ttl
for validity.
.PP
It is good practice to run it over your plugins as part of your continuous
integration after checking them for validity with \fBsord_validate\fP and
before releasing them to the public
